Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id. Ex:

$ show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.
destroy:
Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). Ex:

$ destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.
all:
Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. Example to show all instances
